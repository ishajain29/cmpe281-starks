This Wiki page contains information about how team implemented LEAN value **Eliminate Waste** during each week.

### What is Eliminate Waste?
It is a core principle of LEAN which provides guidelines to remove waste during software development. A feature, functionality, process step is considered as a waste if it doesn't add up as a value to a customer. It is considered as an opposite of value. When a waste is identified, it should be removed from the system, product or process.

## Week-1
* As this was the first week of the project, we did not have any code or feature related issues where we can apply this principle.
* While discussing the overall project architecture and technologies, we tried to eliminate the waste which is created by re-learning. Meaning, not using the knowledge that is available within team members.
* Based on the experience and knowledge, each team member gave information about the database and front-end technologies which can be used to develop the project so that a team member doesn't select some technology to which no one is familiar and get stuck in the upcoming phase.

## Week-2
* This week we have tried to eliminate the waste which is generally created by the extra features. This type of waste is created by providing more than what is needed or asked for.
* As we were discussing the functionalities of the Shopping Portal, each team member came up with the functionalities of their domains. Some of those features were not needed to get the shopping portal work. Those were the extra features.
* Mutually, we agreed upon such features and decided to prepare the list of only basic and necessary features for individual's domain so that we don't complicate the development and prioritize tasks.

## Week-3
* This week we tried to eliminate the waste which is generally created by partially done work. One of the possible reasons of this type of waste is improper dependencies for a story based on other stories.
* As we have started development of the web services from this week for all the data domains, there are number of services for which the result is dependent on the output of the web service of other domain.
* During this meeting, we identified several possible dependencies for some features. We decided to develop web services in such a way that it doesn't create wait time for the dependent web service. We will try to do tasks in parallel as much as possible.
