This Wiki page contains information about how team implemented Extreme Programming(XP) value **Communication** during each week.

### What does Communication mean in Extreme Programming(XP)?

* Extreme programming techniques can be viewed as methods for rapidly building and disseminating institutional knowledge among members of a development team. 

* The goal is to give all developers a shared view of the system which matches the view held by the users of the system.

* To this end, extreme programming favors simple designs, common metaphors, collaboration of users and programmers, frequent verbal communication, and feedback.

## Week 1

* In first week we were new to each other and communication at first is very important. We had two team meeting on Saturday and Monday to discuss about how we are going to build the software and how we are dividing the work. 
* We created team group on Slack for better communication and taking polls when we are not together. 
* During first week everyone was involved in the team meeting and was very enthusiastic about the product we are developing. Everyone shared their views on how we should approach and what technologies we should use to get the best possible output.

## Week 2

* This week we communicated during our meeting hour as well as on our team's slack channel how to proceed to our project.
* All the team members shared their views on how to manage git structures and git branches. 
* Moreover to this, everyone discussed on how they are going to proceed in upcomming week. And discussed about the basic features that we should be focusing at the initial stage of the development.

## Week 3
* This week we decided how we will be approaching our project goal during our weekly meeting.
* During team meeting, everyone shared their thoughts on their functionality and how they are going to implement it. Their dependency to other modules and how they will share data between other modules.
* The communication went well and everyone got the idea about the system as a whole and what will be the features of the system.

## Week 4
* This week we communicated about the problems that we are facing or we may face due to the distributed nature of the system. After a break of one week it was important to communicate well and get everyone back on track.
* Everyone shared thier thoughts their own webservices and what are the dependencies that their module rely on. We communicated about which frontend technologies we can use and gave their opinion about their knowledge on that some technologies.
* Everyone discussed upon how they are going to proceed this week, what are the challanges that they facing. Everybody gave suggestions to each others.

## Week 5
* From this week new phase of design patterns is starting in the project. This will also mean more ingeration tasks will come up. I forcast that the task of maintaining good communicaiton lines will increase and I will have to work harder to keep track that the team members are effectively speaking to each other.
* The team's communication was robust as the changes in the design pattern arrived. We decided how we will create ui for the product. Adopting the new pattern was not easy as most of the teammates were new to the design pattern. But after a meeting and discussion everyone knew how they will proceed to this methodology and everyone got enough knowledge to adapt new method.

## Week 6
* This week we started developing user interface for our shared shooping cart appliation. For that the initial communication with the team wass very important. So I scheduled the meeting early so that everyone has enough information about what they are developing and how they will be developing.
* Everyone stated their views on how should be the UI during the meeting as well as on the slack channel.

## Week 7

* This week we decided to complete user interface development with web service integration. So, we will need to meet more frequently in the weeks ahead. We might need to do pair programming in order to be more productive. Communication amongst the team members is very important and I will try to coordiante in the comming week. Working with the Scrum board is still a daunting task and I hope to be able to do it correctly.
